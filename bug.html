This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-selector like `:hover` or `:focus`. The `@apply` directive doesn't correctly handle these pseudo-selectors, resulting in the styles not being applied correctly.

```html
<button class="@apply hover:bg-blue-500">Hover me</button>
```

This will not apply the `bg-blue-500` class when hovering over the button because the `@apply` directive does not understand how to resolve the pseudo-selector.

Another scenario is when using `@apply` with a class that uses responsive modifiers like `md:`. If the screen size doesn't match the specified breakpoint, then the styles won't be applied.

```html
<div class="@apply md:bg-red-500">Responsive div</div>
```
